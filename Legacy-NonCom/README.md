# Commitments of Traders Viewer

## Overview
This Shiny application provides an interactive way to view the weekly Commitments of Traders (CoT) published by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC). Users can select different markets, along with a date range, to explore historical and most recent CoT data. The application displays this information in an easy-to-read table, enhanced by color coding and detailed descriptions of each data column.


## Features
- **Interactive Filters**: Users can filter the CoT data by selecting the market and date range.
- **Dynamic Table Display**: The data is presented in a table format with options to interactively explore different time frames.
- **Column Descriptions**: Provides descriptions for each column to help users understand the metrics used in the CoT reports.


## About the Data

#### [**Commitments of Traders (COT) Reports Descriptions**](https://www.cftc.gov/MarketReports/CommitmentsofTraders/index.htm)

There are four main reports:

1. Legacy (**<ins>THIS APP USES DATA FROM THIS REPORT</ins>**) -- The Legacy reports are broken down by exchange. These reports have a futures only report and a combined futures and options report. Legacy reports break down the reportable open interest positions into two classifications: non-commercial and commercial traders.

2. Supplemental -- The Supplemental report includes 13 select agricultural commodity contracts for combined futures and options positions. Supplemental reports break down the reportable open interest positions into three trader classifications: non-commercial, commercial, and index traders.

3. Disaggregated -- The Disaggregated reports are broken down by agriculture, petroleum and products, natural gas and products, electricity and metals and other physical contracts. These reports have a futures only report and a combined futures and options report. The Disaggregated reports break down the reportable open interest positions into four classifications:
   
    * Producer/Merchant/Processor/User
    * Swap Dealers
    * Managed Money
    * Other Reportables
    
4. Traders in Financial Futures -- The Traders in Financial Futures (TFF) report includes financial contracts, such as currencies, US Treasury securities, Eurodollars, stocks, VIX and Bloomberg commodity index. These reports have a futures only report and a combined futures and options report. The TFF report breaks down the reportable open interest positions into four classifications:
   
    * Dealer/Intermediary
    * Asset Manager/Institutional
    * Leveraged Funds
    * Other Reportables
